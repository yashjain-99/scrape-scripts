    "which one is better lpu or Chandigarh university": [
      " Hi Deepraj, CU is a good university. LPU is one of the top private university in India and among top 200 in the world. I have listed reasons below for anyone to choose LPU above others. International Exposure: Not only in India, LPU is renowned internationally. LPU has a dedicated Division of International affairs. LPU has ties with Multiple foreign Universities all over the world. Students can take the opportunity to opt for Credit Transfer Program, Semester Exchange Program, Summer / Winter School Program. With this provision, students will get the opportunity of being educated with the advanced technologies of the world renowned Universities. With the huge diversity in campus, students also get the provision of cultural exchange. Attendance :\u00a0LPU is also very strict on the attendance of the students. 75% attendance is mandatory for the students at any cost. This is nothing but to make the students systematic & punctual in life. Student\u2019s Club:\u00a0With the aim of all-round development of students, so that students would be getting emerged strongly in each & every domain of life, there are nearly 60 student organizations or clubs created by Lovely Professional University. With this initiative students will never feel alone on campus. Hostel:\u00a0I have also spent 5 Years in LPU Hostel. There I always feel it\u2019s happening all the time !! 0% Ragging, 0% tolerance to any illegal substances like alcohol, drugs etc. Strict action used to be taken against the defaulters in case of non-adherence of such rules. Though there are many restrictions you can observe for the hostellers but believe me at the end of day you will find it necessary for all your security & safety. These restrictions would definitely make you learn how to lead your life in a controlled environment. Faculties:\u00a0LPU Professors are always beside the students for their well-being & enhancing their educational standard. Professors of LPU are very friendly & helpful in nature with an intimate, interactive, personalized approach to learning. Students are also allocated with Academic & Industry mentors from Day 1 for guidance till the last academic semester. Infrastructure:\u00a01. LPU is a 600+ Acre campus with all advanced facilities & infrastructures (Hospital, Shopping Mall, Gym, Indoor Stadium, Post Office, Bank, Food Courts with International cuisines, Hostel Facility etc.) 2. There are huge well maintained open grounds for outdoor games. Lovely Professional University does have an Olympic Standard swimming pool within the campus inside the SHANTI DEVI MITTAL INDOOR STADIUM. Diving pool & warming up pool are also adjacent to Swimming Pool. LPU is also having the best trainers to train students rightly, and with full safety & security. 3. Students can practice a variety of sports like Badminton, Basketball, Shooting, Boxing, or avail the GYM facility. Placement: Let me quote the placement scenario of last session as I got to know from my alumni page of LPU, In terms of placement in 2020, it was really tough for all to proceed further. It\u2019s tough for a University who wants to promote its students to get excellent placement. It\u2019s tough for the companies also to take decisions on the acquisition of excellent young talents. Thanks to the availability of advanced technologies, upgraded stuffs in LPU & since the students were well prepared by LPU to overcome any of the situations to achieve their final goal, Lovely Professional University managed to achieve excellent placement record as always by securing more than 7000 job offers, internships, training for its students",

      " Yes you can totally get into CU with a 67 percentile in JEE mains 2020, if you\u2019re seeking admission in any of the engineering streams under CU. Further I would like to mention the admission criteria for getting into CU.  The student must score 65% and above in their 10+2 for general category and 55% and above for the reserved category.   For getting into a B.tech course, the student must have a combination of PCM for general engineering streams such as Mechanical/Computer science/ Electrical/Civil/Aerospace and should have a combination of PCM or PCB or PCMB for other branches such as biotechnology/food technology etc.   Direct admission can also be done through CUCET( chandigarh University common entrance test) which is basically a scholarship programme ensuring 100% scholarship to deserving candidates. This examination is conducted prior to admission procedures.   Summing up: Being a Private University, Lower JEE score can also fetch you a seat in CU.
